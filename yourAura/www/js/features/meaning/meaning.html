      <p class = "meaning">The aura has long been described as an electromagnetic energy field that surrounds people—like an egg-shaped ball of energy that encompasses the body. The aura consists of seven levels: the physical, astral, lower,
      higher, spiritual, intuitional, and absolute planes.</p>

      <p class ="meaning">Each one of these subtle bodies that exists around the physical body has its own unique frequency. They are interrelated, and each body affects the others. They also affect a person’s feelings, emotions, thought patterns, behavior, and overall health.</p>
      <p class="meaning"> Just like with chakras, a state of imbalance in one of the bodies leads to a state of imbalance in the others.</p>
      <p class ="meaning">Our aura is our shield, it guards us from outside impurities, and negativities. The color portrayed-although invisiable to the average human signifies our spiratiuality. The more in touch one is spiratually the more emergy one emits and the brighter their aura shines. People with bright auras tend to draw others in becasue of their optism, however, you can have a bright negative aura that is casued by hostility.</p>
      <p class="meaning">Your aura defines your connection to both the inner and outside world and can attract others or casue others to be repelled away. It also expresser you level of self-worth and contemptment.</p>
