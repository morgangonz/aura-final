      <p class = "meaning">The aura has long been described as an electromagnetic energy field that surrounds people—like an egg-shaped ball of energy that encompasses the body. The aura consists of seven levels/layers/auric bodies, also known as the physical, astral, lower,
        higher, spiritual, intuitional, and absolute planes.</p>

      <p class ="meaning">Each one of these subtle bodies that exists around the physical body has its own unique frequency. They are interrelated, and each body affects the others. They also affect a person’s feelings, emotions, thought patterns, behavior, and overall health.
        Just like with chakras, a state of imbalance in one of the bodies leads to a state of imbalance in the others.</p>
