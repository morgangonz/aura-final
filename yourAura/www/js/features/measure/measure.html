      <p style="color:#000000;">View your aura colors by holding your index fingers tip to tip. Standing in front of a plainly colored or white wall, hold your arms out at arms' length in front of you, index fingers still touching. Slowly pull them apart, relaxing your vision
        to almost “zone out,” and you will likely see an outline surrounding your fingers of a light blue/gray light. This is your first glimpse of auric energy. The more you practice, the more you will see and the more vivid the colors will become.</p>
