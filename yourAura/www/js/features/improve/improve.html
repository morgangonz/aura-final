    <h2>7 Ways to strengthen your aura:</h2>

<p>
<h4>1. Salt Water baths</h4>
Use sea salt, Epsom salt or rock salt, as these salts are rich in their connection to nature, energetically powerful and natural cleansers. The salt will effectively rinse off stress, negativity, fatigue... from your body. If you have a tub, you can soak in the salted water for minimum 20 minutes or simply rub sea salt on your skin. 
<br>
<h4>2. Meditate</h4>
The soothing rewards of meditation cannot be explained in words because it helps to enhance the strength and positivity of the aura. We are often exposed to tamasic energies or dark places/people. If we are aware of such situations approaching us, we can simply meditate beforehand and create a protection shield around us.
<br> 
<h4>3. Satsang</h4>
Satsang basically means keeping good company, a positive, healthy and charged company will enhance your aura. As we meet people, we pick up energies from them, especially from our loved ones who we meet more often than others. Therefore, having good company where you discuss about religious, spiritual or positive topics, will add similar impressions on one’s mind as well as a protective layer.  
<br>
<h4>4. Aura Shower</h4>
Aura Shower allows us to balance our aura immediately and undertake any color on ourselves. Be seated in a secluded place for 10 minutes and close your eyes. Imagine you are seated under a waterfall and the water is pouring on your head washing each and every pore of your body. The cold/warm/hot water is seeping into your body and from your feet it is washing off all the negativity. As you experience complete stillness you can pick a specific color that comes to you at the time of meditation. This color is now the color of the water from the waterfall and washing all over you. With long, deep breaths, you can keep at the whole procedures as long as you please. Simply perform this activity, you will feel replenished, calmer and refreshed.
<br>
<h4>5. Natural Grounding</h4>
Nature is abundant and invigorating. We come from nature, are nature and go back to the source that is nature. When we do not connect to nature for a long time due to our busy schedules, we restrict our energies and do not allow them to vibrate on higher frequencies. Just like plants need sunlight, earth and water to grow, human beings need all of this as well. It is said that our main food is sunlight, but unlike plants we cannot process sunlight directly, we have to consume it through food. Therefore, it is necessary that we revisit earth by walking barefoot on the grass, dipping our feet or whole body in free flowing natural water (river, lake, waterfall) and soak sunlight every day for 10-20 minutes with 40% body exposed.
<br>
<h4>6. Crystals</h4>
Crystals are powerful and reflects sun’s light into your aura. When a specific color is added in your aura with the help of the crystal, it starts reflecting the benefits of the same color. Every color adds certain aspects or qualities in your life. Crystals also help in protecting from psychic attacks, negativity and fear. Wearing or keeping these crystals with you will safeguard you from any negative entity entering your space. Some of the crystals to use are: Black Tourmaline for aura protection, clear quartz for energizing and removing negativity, and amethyst to get in tune with your spirituality.
<br>
<h4>7. Chant</h4>
Lastly but the most important way to keep your aura clean and pure is to chant mantras. Mantras are hymns that protect the mind and body and hold great vibrational power to them. When we regularly chant mantras we develop a connection with the words of the mantra and these words starts resonating and working for us.
<br>
Our space defines our entire existence and if we are unable to keep up with a clean, strong and a whole aura, there is no way we can hope to progress in our life spiritually, physically, materially or emotionally.</p>
